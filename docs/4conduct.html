										<h1>Reflection on Professional Conduct</h1>

									<p>This page should reflect on own professional conduct through the module, and wider&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
									<p>It should include reference to the BCS code of conduct</p>

									<h2>Reflection</h2>
									<p> As a university student working toward a career in cyber security developing professional behaviour is essential both for academic success and for preparing to handle sensitive responsibilities in the workplace. Key qualities such as integrity, accountability, and respect are especially important in this field, where trust and ethical decision making are critical. Demonstrating these behaviours now such as being honest in my assignments, meeting deadlines, and respecting other ideas helps me build a solid foundation for the future. These actions align with the BCS Code of conduct, which highlights the importance of integrity, competence, and acting in the public interest. By developing these habits as a student, I am preparing myself to act responsibly and professionally when dealing with cyber security challenges in the real world. </p>
									<p>Unprofessional behaviour can have negative effects both during university and in a future career. In an academic setting, it can damage my reputation, impact group work, or even lead to disciplinary action. In cyber security, a lack of professionalism, such as mishandling data, or ignoring security protocols could result in major consequences like system breaches or legal issues. The BCS code stresses the importance of safeguarding public interest and keeping professional standards, especially when working with sensitive information. To meet these expectations, I need to continue improving my ethical reasoning, communication skills, and commitment to continuous learning so i can effectively contribute to a secure and trustworthy digital environment.</p>
